# Npn-portal

We have xdebug installed in the dev version of this project.
- Make sure to rename `.vscode/launch.json.ini` to `launch.json`.
- If you are just starting, try to use mysql rather than mariadb. Things you need to change are docker-compose.yml and apache2.conf.
- To start up, enter `docker-compose up` while in the `docker/dev` directory.
